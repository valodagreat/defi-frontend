# DEX APP

DEFI as it's commonly called is known as Decentralized Finance. In this project, I built a Decentralized Exchange for our CryptoDevs Token, where users can swap our token for Ethereum directly without third party interference. Uniswaps version 1 swapping algorithm was used in this project.

This project was built with NextJs for the frontend while the smart contract was written in Solidity, compiled, tested, and verified with **Hardhat**, and deployed on Rinkeby testnet.

DEFI contract address : `0x0BeAC2978e4a291d9C3fbaAd058209CA34B87Eb3`

Smart contract code: [https://github.com/valodagreat/defi-project](https://github.com/valodagreat/defi-project)
